# Language Thoughts
C++
- Strikes a nice balance between low-level performance, and modern convenience.

C
- Can't beat it.
- Sometimes you'd rather join Python instead, though.

Python
- Interpreted language that trades performance for readability, and convenience.
- Performance loss can be ameliorated by understanding what the best methods to do things are.
- Great interviewing language because of how easy it is to work with basic data structures.
- Best overall choice for data science, and machine learning projects. Does `pandas` even have an equivalent?

Rust
- Modern, performant, systems programming language.
- Interesting as a competitor to C, and C++.

Julia
- Modern, performant, scientific computing language.
- Interesting as a competitor to C, C++, and Python.

Bash 
- Shell scripting language.
- Extremely useful, and powerful tool for automation. 

# TODO
- Add recent solutions to python/

- Organize cpp/
- Organize rust/
- Organize bash/
- Organize julia/
